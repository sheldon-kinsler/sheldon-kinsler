Hey there, I'm Sheldon. I'm a Business Analyst with experience in direct sales, data visualization and manipulation using SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. I am eager to use my skills to make informed business decisions and drive sales growth.

Currently, I'm working as a sales coordinator and working with data and insights to improve the sales and consultation processes. My experience with various CRM's and direct client facing communication have helped me develop my communication, analytical, time-management, and problem-solving skills.

In 2023, I enrolled in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program. The curriculum covered data manipulation tools (SQL, Excel), data visualization (Power BI, Tableau), and communication and presentation skills. It also involved numerous real life and practical projects.

Some fun facts about me:
-You can usually always find me in the gym or doing something active like golf
-I have a chihuahua named Huey who was a rescue from Puerto Rico
-I enjoy traveling and trying new things

Feel free to contact me on LinkedIn or Github anytime!
